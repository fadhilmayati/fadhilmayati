Welcome to my DevOps journey! In this repository, I will be documenting my experiences and learning as I work towards becoming a proficient DevOps engineer.

Background
I come from a background in Electrical Engineering, but I've always been interested in the intersection of software development and IT operations. As I learned more about the DevOps methodology and its impact on software delivery, I became excited about the prospect of becoming a DevOps engineer.

Goals
My goals for this DevOps journey are:
To gain a deep understanding of DevOps principles and best practices
To learn key DevOps tools and technologies, such as [insert specific tools and technologies you want to learn]
To develop hands-on experience with DevOps workflows and processes, such as continuous integration and delivery, infrastructure as code, and containerization
To build a portfolio of projects and examples that demonstrate my DevOps skills and expertise


Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to sharing my progress with you!
